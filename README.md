# Matto And Morphie (Unity Codebase)

Matto and Morphie is a 2D platformer game created with the Unity Engine. For more information about the idea (and to play it yourself!) head over to: [website to be created].

Matto and Morphie is being developed by [Nicholas Yao](https://github.com/PShuckle) and [John Chen](https://github.com/johnchen383) 

This repository serves as a home to changes in the Unity Project codebase. Please note that the Unity Collaboration Platform was primarily used in development and GitHub simply served as a means of keeping
all our files (code/design/website) in the same location. Hence, large commits are observed often by a single individual.
